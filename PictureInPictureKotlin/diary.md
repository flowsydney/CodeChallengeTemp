Task 1 - Legacy support

- starting by updating the minSdk and testing the app to check what is a necessity to upgrade
- Fixing the video for API under 26 was something mandatory on a UX perspective because it gives an 
incentive to the user to keep using the app even though they will have minimum features.
- Adding a text under a disabled button is on purpose, chose to hide the button entirely is a good choice
but showing the user that they could, but they can't gives them an overview of what they could have 
-> Triggers FOMO (nefarious tactics i know)
